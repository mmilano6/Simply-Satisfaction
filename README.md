# The-wonderful-world-of-Automated-Devices: Devices that only work when they see your face.

This project is an iteration of an ongoing body of work that explores what 
the relationship between artificially intelligent robots and humans are, 
when they are working with each other. Additionally what role does artificial 
intelligence play in this relationship, and how can we as designers design the 
experience for both the user and the algorithm.

With this project I wanted to explore what automated devices, simplified robots, 
with machine vision would be like to work with. The project was explore through 
several stages:

1) Exploring what an everyday device would be like if it had a robot built into it. 

2)

3)
