# The-wonderful-world-of-Automated-Devices: Devices that only work when they see your face.

This project is an iteration of an ongoing body of work that explores what 
the relationship between artificially inteligent robots and humans are, 
when they are working with each other. Additionally what role does artificial 
intelligence play in this relationship, and how can we as designers design the 
experience for both the user and the algorithm.
