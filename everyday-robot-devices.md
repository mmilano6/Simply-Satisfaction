Exploring what an everyday device would be like if it had a robot built into it.

This is a speculative artificially intelligent robot that I prototyped to explore what it would be like to have a robot
that was dependent on a human to be present in order to do its job. In this case the robotic scissors only work in when
the users face is present. Then once activated the user and robot have to work together to accomplish the task, in this
it is cutting a piece of paper along the drawn line. The prototype uses OpenCV for facial recognition, which then actuates
servos that automate the scissors cutting.

This is a collection of speculative robotic devices that I prototype to explore what the
relationship between a human user and an artificialy intelligent collaboritve robot or cobot would be like.
